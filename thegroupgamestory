Once Upon a Time there was
An archeologist named Kia, every day she spends her time digging for artifacts. One day, while digging in the country of Norway, they hit a large metal tomb and discovered a book that revealed secrets of the Pagan religion that were believed to be lost after the Burning of Alexandria. 
Because of her magnificent discovery, she is now exploring the realm of magic which was believed to only be a myth until now… 
Through the magic, the God mostly found in Egyptian hieroglyphics known as Bast comes to life and begins claiming lives. He spares anyone who has been a nice cat owner. 
Kia owns a cat—has she been a good cat owner? 

Heads: Yes,  Bast rewards her greatly by giving her immortality and power to rule on earth over humans before he returns back to his universe. And ever since then, people respect cats for the Gods that they are.  

Tails: No, Bast sends an army of domestic cats to eat her alive and ever since then, Bast decides to stay on earth and allow cats to rule people by giving them the ability to speak, opposable thumbs, and the ability to control the mind of humans. In turn, making them the superior species on Earth.
