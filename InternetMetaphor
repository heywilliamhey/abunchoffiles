The Internet and World Wide Web, A Metaphor.
Oct. 10, 2015.

The Internet is like the human body. 
In real terms, the Internet is made up of clients and servers. 
In relation to the body, the clients and servers would be all the vital organs. 
The World Wide Web could be described as the signals and the neurological system that sends messages
back and forth between the organs and the brain. The World Wide could also be the circulatory 
system within the body. The cells within the circulatory system, as well as the neurological 
signals are the communication that can be understood within the entire body.
